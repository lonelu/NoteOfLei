Try to run STAR and Cufflink based on 'Mapping RNA-seq reads with STAR' protocol 3 and protocol 8 on Ubuntu.
The data I guess is unpaired because of they are all single. But stranded or un-stranded? Output BAM Unsorted or SortedByCoordinate? 
> cd /mnt/e/Lei/RNAData/
> STAR --runThreadN 20 --genomeDir /mnt/e/Lei/RNAData/GRCh38.91STARIndex/ 
       --readFilesIn /mnt/e/Lei/RNAData/AC9E6PANXX/d-R1_ACCTCA_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz 
       --readFilesCommand gunzip -c 
       --sjdbGTFfile /mnt/e/Lei/RNAData/GRCh38.91STARIndex/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.91.gtf 
       --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate
The --readFilesCommand gunzip -c still doesn't seem like work. Delete it and use the unzip fastq file.
Also STAR 2.4 doesn't work, which maybe installed by 'sudo apt-get install STAR'. Try to uninstall it.
