Try to run STAR and Cufflink based on 'Mapping RNA-seq reads with STAR' protocol 3 and protocol 8 on Ubuntu.
? The data I guess is unpaired because of they are all single. But stranded or un-stranded? Output BAM Unsorted or SortedByCoordinate? 
> cd /mnt/e/Lei/RNAData/
> STAR --runThreadN 20 --genomeDir /mnt/e/Lei/RNAData/GRCh38.91STARIndex/ 
       --readFilesIn /mnt/e/Lei/RNAData/AC9E6PANXX/d-R1_ACCTCA_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz 
       --readFilesCommand gunzip -c 
       --sjdbGTFfile /mnt/e/Lei/RNAData/GRCh38.91STARIndex/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.91.gtf 
       --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate
The --readFilesCommand gunzip -c still doesn't seem like work. Delete it and use the unzip fastq file.
Also STAR 2.4 doesn't work, which maybe installed by 'sudo apt-get install STAR'. Try to uninstall it. 
Create a Bash script makes life easier!

Install Cufflinks based on protocol 8.
> ~/STAR/bin/cufflinks-2.2.1.Linux_x86_64/cufflinks -p20 --library-type fr-firststrand Aligned.sortedByCoored.out.bam

? how to run several samples at same time or in one command line? (maybe in one script)
