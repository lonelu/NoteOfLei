Here's the proteoform database engine repository to start perusing: https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/ProteoformDatabaseEngine

1. Get Linux subsystem for windows working on your computer.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about

Update it by typing the commands `sudo apt-get install PACKAGE` where PACKAGE is each of the following: 
                // installers
                "gcc",
                "g++",
                "make",
                "cmake",
                "build-essential",

                // file compression
                "zlib1g-dev",

                // bioinformatics
                "samtools",
                "tophat",
                "cufflinks",
                "bedtools",
                "picard-tools",

                // commandline tools
                "gawk",
                "git",
                "python",
                "python-dev",
                "python-setuptools",
                "libpython2.7-dev",

2. Download the FASTQ files from the link I sent you from the Bresnick lab.
3. Clone the seqtk repository from https://github.com/lh3/seqtk
4. Check out the seqtk tool by going to its directory in the bash commandline tool and typing `seqtk -h`
5. Subset one of the bresnick rna-seq runs with 
`seqtk sample -s 0 reads1.fastq > newreads1.fastq`
`seqtk sample -s 0 reads2.fastq > newreads2.fastq`
6. Here's the STAR aligner: https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR
Clone the repository, change directories into the STAR folder, then type `make` in the directory to build it.
7. Try running the STAR aligner on the bresnick data. It's located in STAR/source. I attached an example command produced by PDE.
